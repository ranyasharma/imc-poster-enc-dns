\begin{abstract}
Previous studies have measured encrypted DNS performance, but they have mostly focused on mainstream DNS resolvers~\cite{hounsel2020comparing,hoang2020k,lu2019end-to-end}.
We expand on previous studies, exploring the performance of all encrypted DNS resolversâ€”from a variety of global
vantage points, as opposed to simply characterizing the mainstream DoH providers from well-connected vantage points. Our goal is to compare the performance of encrypted DNS resolvers to each other to understand the extent to which this larger set of DNS resolvers could be used by clients and applications in different regions.
